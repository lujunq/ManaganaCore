Issues found on OPENFL
updated on 2016-01-02

VIDEO ON HTML5
	* video size setting on canvas output (width and height) is not effective (works on DOM)
	* video display doesn't work on webgl output (only the sound plays)
	* "videoWidth" and "videoHeight" (original media size) always return 0 on HTML5 (ok on Flash)
		> __stream.__video.videoHeight and __stream.__video.videoWidth at openfl.media.Video does return the right value
	* NetStream.time doesn't return the current playback time for the loaded video (works on on Flash)
		> __stream.__video.currentTime at openfl.media.Video return the correct value
	* NetStream doesn't dispatch the metadata event on video load so there is no way to recover the correct total video duration (get from the metadata info on Flash)
		> __stream.__video.duration at openfl.media.Video return the correct value
		
MASKS ON HTML5
	* masking a sprite with another sprite produces inverted results on HTML5 (ok on Flash)
		> using a Shape object for masking produces the expected results

SOUND ON HTML5
	* Sound.length always return 0 on HTML5 (ok on Flash)
		> __soundInstance.getDuration() at openfl.media.SoundChannel provides the correct value
